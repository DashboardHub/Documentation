|===
|What worked well |What could be improved |Suggested actions
|Team were good at speaking to people | Our backs were sometimes towards the public and we could've missed opporunities | N/A

|The two days of prep worked in our favour | Better understanding of the engineering of the product, so able to articulate the nuances of the product | N/A

|We failed fast - realised quickly that the original plan of having presence in the dev lounge wasn't working, so we re-grouped and started again | Wasn't sure who our target audience was. Techies thought the tool was for non-techies, and non-techies thought it was for techies | N/A

|We arrived early and was one of the last to leave. This meant we were able to maximise the day | Could've had a banner to cover the wooden frame at the bottom of the stand to advertise the product. It was wasted space | N/A

|Our interpersonal skills were apparent, and we had the emotional maturity to deal with each others quirks | Facilitation of interpersonal skills | N/A 

|We were able to quickly adapt to the each person who came to the stand | Create a more visually appealing stand to attract more people | N/A

|Networking with other startups at the stands | Could've improved on the social media | N/A

| | Had dedicated people to speak to other startups | N/A

|Appreciating the people standing right next to you| Speaking to everyone in the stands near us | N/A
